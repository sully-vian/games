# Clash of Circles

## Concept

### The Players

In "Clash of Circles," there are two players: Red and Blue. Each player is represented by a vibrant circle of their respective color. The players begin the game on opposite sides of the playfield, ready to engage in a strategic battle of wits and timing.

### The Attack

Each player possesses a powerful, triggerable attack in the form of an explosion. This explosion radiates outward in a circular area from the player's position. If the opposing player is caught within this explosive radius, they are immediately defeated. The attack takes 10 seconds to recharge, but players are not obligated to use it as soon as it becomes available. This one-shot capability makes the attack a formidable tool that must be used judiciously to maximize its impact.

### The Playfield

The playfield is a square arena where the players can move freely. This confined space sets the stage for intense, strategic maneuvering as each player attempts to outmaneuver the other, creating a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

### The Goal

The ultimate objective of "Clash of Circles" is to be the last player standing. If a player is hit by the opponent's attack, they are eliminated from the game. The game concludes when only one player remains, crowning them the victor in this high-stakes duel of strategy and precision.
